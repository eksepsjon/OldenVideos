        "description": "For media requests or any other questions contact David's dad at dad@davidafterdentist.com\n\nThis is a video of my then 7 year old son David in May 2008I had my Flip video camera with me. His mom wasnt able to go becasue of work. I taped some of the morning before the surgery to show her and was already planning to tape afterwards. He had just had a tooth removed due to Hyperdontia or extra tooth. This was taken in the parking lot of the dentist office. He was so out of it. The staff was even laughing. This lasted for a few hours and he was fine. He even laughed at the video that night.\n\nHe is very smart and always has something interesting to say about many different issues. His philosophical reaction to the medication didnt really suprise us.\n\nDavid is a very good kid and I am blessed to have he and his brother William as sons.\n\nThis has been a great experience for our family. Thanks for watching.\n\nFor more info on D.A.D come visit us at:\nhttp://www.davidafterdentist.com",
