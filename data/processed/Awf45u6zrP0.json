  "description": "The music makes this video a million times funnier. I've seen this version on tumblr (http://videohall.tumblr.com/post/22947862416/anybody-know-what-happened-to-the-cat) but not on YouTube, so I thought I'd bring it on over.\n\nEDIT: I've answered this in the comments, but people are still asking, so I thought I'd post it here--yes, the cat survived. It says so in the original video description.\n\nOriginal video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g85wBkhFhjo",
