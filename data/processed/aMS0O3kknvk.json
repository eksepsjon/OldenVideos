  "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaX0__vPdN8\n\nhttp://travege.com\n\nAs seen on time magazine dot com this is known as one of the funniest videos in internet video history. Watch as a news reporter falls off the stage during a quick grape stomping contest. She is now infamously called the grape lady. So sit back and watch the grape lady fall!\n\n**May 30th 2011 update**\nThanks to everyone who has watched our grape lady falls video over the years. It's awesome to see that going on 10,000,000 people have watched this video.",
