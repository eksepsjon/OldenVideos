Support us if you can/want.\nhttps://www.patreon.com/freckle\n---\nWANT A SHIRT? - \nhttp://www.cafepress.com/frecklestudios\n---\nWait until after the awesome hand-jig and be amazed.  Now comes with blurriness AND the moment near the end where I fall over and kill my toes - but keep going!\n---\nLet me clarify: This is all one take; there is no editing except the words at the beginning.  This is also the original.  These are my hands.\n\nThanks for all the positive feedback!",
